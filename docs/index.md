# KBox
KBox is a very small but useful utility library for Kotlin (JVM, Android and JS).

# Installation

KBox is published to maven central.

```
repositories { mavenCentral() }
dependencies {
    implementation("ch.tutteli.kbox:kbox-jvm:0.16.0")
}
```

Accordingly, you can use `kbox-js` as artifactId instead of `kbox-jvm`
(or simply `kbox` in case of a MPP project in commonMain).
